                Fairweather Tourist was created by Himanshu H., Simo L., Gemma Q. and Vlad Z., who are students of the
                English language programme of information technology at Metropolia University of Applied Science. The
                higher education facility is located in the capital city of Finland, Helsinki.
                <br><br>The game was given as a group project assignment during the first year of the study and was
                implemented
                in two phases in 2022. The criteria for the project was to create a flight simulator game that utilises
                both a flight
                database and an API. The idea behind this game, besides fulfilling the expectations, is to spread the
                joy of travelling and encourage people to discover more of the wonderful world we live in.
                <br><br>During the first phase, the prototype game was coded in python language using Pycharm IDE
                within the period of two and a half weeks. The flight database was originally from an open database
                source
                and MariaDB was used for its implementation.
                The outcome was playable through the console of the IDE, where the player could read through the rules
                and was able to interact through the keyboard.
                <br><br>During the second phase of the project, a frontend was implemented for the game using HTML, CSS
                and JavaScript. For the backend, the python code for the prototype was re-evaluated along with the existing
                database. In addition to these, a real-time weather API, OpenWeather, was also integrated into the
                project. For this part of the project, a period of three weeks was dedicated.
                <br><br>What you currently see, is the outcome of this project. We, the creators, hope you give our game a try
                and find as much joy playing it as we enjoyed creating it.
